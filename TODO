* setVar allows `Var a` to be set to any value, the value
  is not constrained to be of type `a`. This seems necessary
  to allow, eg, `setVar v (Output (cmd "read"))`. On other
  hand, it's subptimal when using setVar with a Arith; in this
  case `a` should be some Integral.

* Allow: test (n `TEqual` 42)

* Add an instance: Num a => Num (Var a)

  This could make `var1 + var2` yield `APlus var1 var2`. And so ease
  construction of Arith expressions.

  Seems very doable!
