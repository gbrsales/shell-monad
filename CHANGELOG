shell-monad (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Always render comments using : , not #
    This ensures that some oddball constuctions, eg making a pipe
    to a comment, always generate valid shell code.

shell-monad (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added a nice interface to the test command. Test is a GADT,
    which allows constraining numeric tests to only accept
    Integral Vars.
  * Fix bug in lengthVar.
  * Fix the variable returned by lengthVar so it can be expanded
    inside an arithmetic expression.
  * Fixed composition of defaultVar, whenVar, errUnlessVar, and
    trimVar.
  * The Var data type has been renamed to Term Var.
  * There is also a Term Static, for static values from haskell.
  * Instead of Val x, use static x.
  * Implemented a Num instance for Arith, so now Arith can be built
    up from regular haskell expressions, for example:
    val x * (100 + val y)

shell-monad (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * newVarContaining is generalized to work for all showable data types.

shell-monad (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Var now has a phantom type. This allows the haskell type checker
    to type check untyped shell variables!
  * added Arith
  * Really fix stopOnFailure. Strings. So easy to typo three times.

shell-monad (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed linear rendering of caseOf

shell-monad (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Renamed a few operators.
  * Added defaultVar, whenVar, lengthVar, and trimVar.
  * Due to changes in how variable expansion is handled, the val function
    has been removed, and WithVar should be used instead.
  * newVar now ensures that the variable starts out empty.
  * Added caseOf
  * Fix bug in stopOnFailure.

shell-monad (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Simple support for globs.
  * Fixed propigation of the outer monad's state into Output,
    which fixes a bug in the unusual case where variables or funtions
    are defined inside Output.
  * Support redirection, including redirection from here-documents.
  * Here documents are emulated in linearScript output mode.
  * cmd is now polymorhpic on its first argument, allowing
    the command to run to be specified using String, Var, or even
    Output.

shell-monad (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * newVar, newVarContaining, takeParameter, and func all
    now take a namehint parameter, which can be () or (NameHinted "foo").
